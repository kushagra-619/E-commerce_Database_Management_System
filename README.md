This project involves the development of a comprehensive database management system for an e-commerce platform. The system is designed to handle various aspects of online retail operations, including inventory management, order processing, customer information, product cataloging, and shipping logistics.

## Business Requirements:

Create a relational database structure to support e-commerce operations.

Implement tables for products, inventory, orders, customers, sellers, and shipping.

Establish relationships between different entities in the database.

Develop stored procedures for efficient data insertion and management.

Implement queries to extract meaningful business insights.

Ensure data integrity through proper constraints and foreign key relationships.


### Steps Taken to Complete the Project:

Database Design:
Created tables for various entities such as order_detail, inventory, product, category, condition, seller, orders, consumer, address, shipping_type, package, and shipment.

Table Creation:
Executed SQL commands to create the necessary tables with appropriate columns and data types.

Stored Procedures Development:
Implemented stored procedures for adding data to different tables, including ADD_CONSUMER, ADD_INVENTORY, ADD_ORDERS, ADD_SHIPPING_TYPE, ADD_ADDRESS, ADD_PACKAGE, ADD_CATEGORY, and ADD_PRODUCT.

Data Insertion:
